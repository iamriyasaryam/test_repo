# 🛡️ Companion Verification System

Companion is a social platform designed specifically for developers to showcase **real skills**, **authentic projects**, and **verified portfolios** — eliminating the noise and false claims from traditional resumes.

---

## ✅ Why Verification Matters

In today’s world, developers can easily:
- Copy projects from GitHub.
- Claim skills with no real experience.
- Add fake education/experience on resumes.

**Companion changes that.**  
We verify everything — projects, skills, education, and experience — using a **multi-layered AI + Community + Manual Review approach.**

## 🔍 Project Verification

Each submitted project undergoes a **100-point evaluation system**. Here’s how:

### 📊 Point Breakdown (Max 100 Points)
| Criteria | Description | Points |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| Codebase Analysis | Analyzes original code contributions vs copied code. | 20 |
| Commit History | Detects active development streak, depth & frequency. | 15 |
| AI Similarity Detection | Fingerprint detection for copied/AI-modified code. | 15 |
| Timeline Check | Ensures time spent aligns with expected complexity. | 10 |
| Feature Review | Manual/AI check on project’s UI, functionality. | 10 |
| User-Declared Source | Self-disclosed origin (AI-generated / Followed tutorial / Original). | 5 |
| Community Endorsements | Real users endorse usefulness or authenticity. | 10 |
| Feedback & Comments | Reviews from others on the platform. | 5 |
| Tutorial/Clone Pattern Match | Detect if project is tutorial-based or clone with minimal effort. | -10 (if detected) |

### 🔁 Resubmission & Appeals
- Users can request a **manual review** if the score is too low.
- Projects can be **resubmitted with improvements**.

## 🧠 Skill Verification

Skills added to the profile are verified using:

| Method | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Project-Skill Mapping | Matches skills used in verified projects. |
| Dev Activity | Checks consistency in using the skill across the platform. |
| Quiz (Optional) | Optional short MCQs to verify core concepts. |
| Endorsements | Community or collaborators can endorse your skill. |
| Cross-Validation | AI evaluates whether described skills match coding patterns. |

### 🔐 Skill Confidence Score
Every skill gets a confidence percentage from 0–100%.  
> Only skills above 70% are marked **Verified**.

---

## 🎓 Education & Experience Verification

These are verified using a **3-tiered logic**:

| Step | Verification Technique |
|------|------------------------|
| Document Upload | Certificate/Degree/Offer Letter upload with AI + OCR validation. |
| Email/Domain Matching | Validates against official institution or company domains. |
| Manual Spot Check | Random selection for manual review. |
| Timeline Consistency | Ensures logical sequence with other achievements. |

---

## 🔔 Reporting & Community Validation

### 🚩 Community Reports
Users can report:
- Copied code
- Fake claims
- Mismatched timelines

#### Action Steps:
| Report Count | Action |
|--------------|--------|
| 1–2 | Flag shown privately. |
| 3 | Red warning shown to owner. |
| 4–6 | Project/skill marked for re-review. |
| 7+ or Mass Reporting | Temporarily hidden from public view & recruiters. |

---

## 💯 User Trust Score

Every user has a **Trust Score (0–1000)**:
- Verified projects, skills, education, and activity build it.
- Inactivity, rejected verifications, and bad reports reduce it.
- Used to filter and rank users on recruiter dashboards.

---

## 🧠 Verification Engine Architecture

### Key Technologies:
- **AI Models** for code analysis, plagiarism, fingerprinting.
- **NLP Matching** for skill-to-code relevance.
- **Community Moderation** + Endorsement graphs.
- **Manual Review Interface** for high-risk content.

---

## 🚀 Future Plans

- 🎓 University Partner Verification API.
- 🧑‍💼 LinkedIn/GitHub Activity Sync & Analysis.
- 🧪 AI-generated Project Analysis Scoring Model.
- 🧬 Code Quality Metric Engine (Code smells, performance checks).
- 🔁 Feedback loop between recruiter hiring & project quality.

---

## 🎯 Goal

> Build the most **trustworthy portfolio** and **developer identity layer** on the internet.  
Where skills are not just claimed — but **verified**.
